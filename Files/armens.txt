ALL OF THIS ONGOING SIMPLY TO GET THE TEXT ALONG TO SUBPARAGRAPH 832, WHICH IS QUITE A WAYS DOWN THE PAGE. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT CLEVER STUFF. BOY ARE YOU WRONG. THAT GOES DOUBLE FOR ANYONE WHO HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL TREATY. MOST OF THOSE LAWYER FOLKS ARE LIKE IN THE HOSPITAL, ALONG WITH EXECUTIVES OF THE SIRRIUS CYBERNETICS CORPORATION. IT TOOK THAT SHES LIKE FOREVER. RICK IS INITIALLY GETTING A KEI AND YURI REFERENCE INTO THE TEXT. YOU KNOW, THE TWO CUTE GIRLS WITH THE BIG GUNS. WE MIGHT ALSO MENTION AKIRA, RANMA NIBUNNOICHI, RHEA GALL FORCE, URUSEI YATSURA, AND A FEW OTHER ANIMATED FILMS. THE FEDERATION AT THIS POINT IN TIME SEEMS MORE TANGLED UP.

IN THE TEXT OF THE TREATY, OR DIDN'T ANYONE THINK ABOUT THAT EVENTUALITY WHEN THE BLOODY DOCUMENT WAS FIRST DRAWN UP? NEVER MIND. IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION ANYWAY. BUT WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D TRY AND DEMONSTRATE OUR LEGALISTIC CLEVERNESS. JUST ONE MORE PARAGRAPH UNTIL THE CRITICAL ONE, WHERE WE TALK ABOUT CONSULTATIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING. THE SHELIACS DON'T SOUND LIKE A RACE SELLING PLANETS TO, IF WE HAVE TO WRITE (MUCH LESS READ) ONE OF THESE CONTRACTS EACH TIME. ALTHOUGH, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE COMPUTERS, SO WE CAN SEARCH-AND-REPLACE.
